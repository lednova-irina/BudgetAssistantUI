## Initial brand-new setup
As an initial setup for a fresh environment, before executing Terraform scripts need to perform a few manual actions:

1. Request new domain from Route53: [AWS Route53: Domains](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53/domains/home)
2. Following instructions to setup GitHib actions and Terraform Cloud integrations [Automate Terraform with GitHub Actions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/automation/github-actions)
3. Request ACM Certificate [AWS ACM](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1#/certificates/request)
4. Register Auth0 account and configure ClientId and ClientSecret.

> NOTE: Project currently configured to be deployed on AWS `US-EAST-1` 

## Setup new env
1. Copy and modify [assistants-budget-ops/develop](./assistants-budget-ops/develop/) with new env name. like `production`;
2. Create a new Enviroment in GitHub;
3. Setup Environment GitHub Variables;
4. Run [Assistants. Budget - Ops](./.github/workflows/ops.yml) pipeline to setup env;
   1. Make sure to select appropriate Environment before execution of GitHub Action;
